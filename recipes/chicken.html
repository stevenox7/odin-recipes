    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is gonna be the <strong>juicest</strong> chicken 
    breast you'll ever have!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to even thickness and brined in saltwater</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon melted butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brine the chicken. To brine your chicken breasts, fill a large bowl with 1 quart of warm water and 1/4 cup kosher salt.  Stir to combine until most of the salt is absorbed.  Add the chicken breasts and let them sit in the mixture to brine for 15 minutes.  Or you can also also cover the bowl and refrigerate for up to 6 hours.  Remove the chicken breasts from the brine, rinse them with cold water, then pat them dry with some paper towels.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven. Preheat oven to 450Â°F.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken. Place the chicken breasts in a single layer in a large baking dish*.  Brush on both sides (turning once) evenly with the melted butter or olive oil.  In a separate small bowl, whisk the salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika until combined.  Then sprinkle the mixture evenly over the chicken on both sides.</li>
        <li>Bake. Bake for 15-18* minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink.  Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the chicken breasts, so I recommend using a cooking thermometer to know exactly when it is fully cooked. </li>
        <li>Rest the chicken. Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the oven, transfer the chicken to a clean plate, and loosely tent the plate with aluminum foil.  Let the chicken rest for at least 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve. Serve warm.  Or, refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
